## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-17

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed Invisible Components & Startup Crash.** A major, incomplete refactoring was fixed, resolving a bug where game components were invisible. This involved:
  - Implementing a new `Initializer` widget to handle SVG-to-Image processing at startup, ensuring assets are ready before the game loads. (Files: `lib/main.dart`, `lib/ui/svg_capture.dart`).
  - Correcting the `AssetManager` to act as a simple cache and re-introducing a `loadString` method for text-based assets. (File: `lib/services/asset_manager.dart`).
  - Fixing a dependency injection issue in `LevelManagerNotifier` that caused a startup crash. (Files: `lib/services/level_manager.dart`, `lib/core/providers.dart`).
- **CRITICAL: Resolved All Test Compilation Errors.** Fixed multiple errors that prevented the test suite from running.
  - Updated `MockAssetManager` to be consistent with the real `AssetManager` interface. (File: `test/helpers/mock_asset_manager.dart`).
  - Made the `GameEngineNotifier` more testable by exposing its `animationScheduler`. (File: `lib/engine/game_engine_notifier.dart`).
  - Corrected the provider setup in the main test file. (File: `test/level_01_revised_test.dart`).

### Changed
- **Docs: Overhauled Project Documentation.** Performed a full audit of all project documentation to ensure it is up-to-date with the current architecture.
  - Updated `DOCS/Architecture.md` to reflect the new `AssetManager` design.
  - Updated `DOCS/CodeExecutionFlow.md` and `README.md` with recent changes.
  - Appended a new, prioritized roadmap to `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.
  - Deleted the obsolete `DOCS/TESTING.md`.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **Test Environment:** Fixed a critical issue where tests would fail because the `LevelManager` could not load level data. Implemented a `MockAssetManager` to allow tests to be primed with asset data, and refactored the test setup to use Riverpod provider overrides. This makes the test environment robust and reliable.
- **Test Compilation Issue**: Resolved "Type 'Component' not found" error in test environment by adding type alias `typedef Component = ComponentModel` in `lib/models/component.dart`. This maintains backward compatibility for tests while preserving the existing `ComponentModel` class structure.
- Tests can now compile and reference the `Component` type as expected by the test helper functions in `test/helpers/level_01_test_helper.dart` and `test/level_01_revised_test.dart`.

### Technical Details
- **Root cause**: Test files were importing and using `Component` type, but the actual class is named `ComponentModel`
- **Solution**: Added `typedef Component = ComponentModel;` to provide the expected type alias
- **Impact**: Minimal change, maintains full backward compatibility, enables test compilation

## [2025-08-14 9PM] - Debugging & Unresolved Test Issues

### Added

-   A new test suite for asset management (`test/common/assets_test.dart`) to ensure all asset paths are valid and prevent broken asset links in the future.

### Fixed

-   Fixed a critical bug in the level parser that caused a crash when loading levels. The parser now correctly handles various direction formats (e.g., "up", "down", "left", "right" in addition to "north", "south", "east", "west"), making the level loading process more robust.
-   Resolved an audio playback issue on the web by converting all `.mp3` audio files to the more broadly supported `.wav` format.

### Changed

-   Refactored the asset management system to improve maintainability and flexibility. This includes:
    -   Centralizing all asset paths into a new `AppAssets` class (`lib/common/assets.dart`).
    -   Simplifying the `AudioService` to be more generic and reusable.
    -   Updating the `AssetManager` to be driven by the new `AppAssets` manifest.

### Debugging & Unresolved Issues

-   **Persistent Test Compilation Error:** Encountered and repeatedly failed to resolve a `Type 'Component' not found` error during test compilation (both macOS and Chrome platforms). This issue remains unresolved despite extensive debugging, project cleaning, and import verification.
-   **macOS Build Environment Issue:** Identified that the macOS application build failed due to missing Xcode command-line tools (`xcodebuild`). This is a separate system configuration issue, not directly related to the `Component` type error, but it prevented macOS test execution.
-   **Outdated Package Dependencies:** Noted that 26 packages have newer versions incompatible with dependency constraints. While not the direct cause of the compilation error, this indicates potential project instability.

### Comprehensive Refactoring & Quality Improvements

This update details a significant effort to enhance code quality, enforce immutability, and resolve numerous analyzer issues across the project.

#### Completed Tasks:
- **Enforced Universal Immutability:**
    - Deleted unused and empty model files (`game_level.dart`, `circuit_component.dart`, `level_goal.dart`).
    - Converted `Position`, `Hint`, `LevelDefinition`, `CellOffset`, `TerminalSpec`, and `ComponentModel` to immutable classes using the `freezed` package.
    - Verified build runner success and confirmed no breaking changes to existing logic due to `GameEngineNotifier`'s already immutable-first approach.
- **Updated Documentation:**
    - `DOCS/LOGIC.md` was updated to accurately reflect the implemented short-circuit detection algorithm.
    - `README.md` was refactored for conciseness, with historical changelog entries moved to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Fixed Analyzer Issues:**
    - Resolved all critical errors (`const_with_non_const`, `undefined_method`, `non_abstract_class_inherits_abstract_member`).
    - Fixed all `deprecated_member_use` warnings by replacing `withOpacity` with `withAlpha` across multiple UI files (`asset_manager.dart`, `circuit_component_painter.dart`, `main_menu.dart`, `component_palette.dart`, `debug_overlay.dart`, `level_card.dart`, `menu_button.dart`).
    - Fixed `curly_braces_in_flow_control_structures` warnings in `asset_manager.dart`.
    - Fixed `prefer_adjacent_string_concatenation` warnings in `main_menu.dart`.
    - Fixed `use_build_context_synchronously` warnings in `level_select.dart` and `level_grid.dart` by refactoring to use `async/await` and robust `mounted` checks.

#### Remaining Minor Issues:
- **`prefer_const_constructors`**: 16 informational warnings remain, primarily in test files, suggesting performance optimizations by adding `const` to constructors where applicable. These do not affect functionality.

## Historical Changes (from README)

This section contains entries that were previously in the README and have been consolidated here for a complete project history.

### 2025-08-13 9pm

#### Asset Pipeline and Rendering Optimization
- **Enhanced `AssetManager` Caching**: The `AssetManager` has been significantly refactored to improve performance and flexibility. It now pre-caches SVG assets as `ui.Image` objects, offloading conversion work from the critical render loop. The previous `PictureInfo` caching has been replaced with a more robust system that stores raw SVG strings and the pre-rendered images.
- **Improved `AssetManager` API**: The service now exposes a more versatile API, allowing assets to be retrieved as `ui.Image`, raw `String`, or `Widget`. It also includes new utility methods for querying asset statistics.
- **Decoupled `CanvasPainter`**: The `CanvasPainter` has been updated to consume the new `ui.Image` objects directly from the `AssetManager`. This decouples the painter from SVG-specific logic, making it more efficient and easier to maintain.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused imports from `level_select.dart` to improve code hygiene.
