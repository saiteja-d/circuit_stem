## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a clean, modular architecture that separates logic, state management, and UI.

*   **Services (`/lib/services`):** Stateless, reusable services like the `LogicEngine` and `LevelManager`.
*   **Engine (`/lib/engine`):** The `GameEngine` orchestrates the state and rules for an active game session.
*   **Models (`/lib/models`):** Plain Dart objects representing the game's data, such as `Grid`, `Component`, and `LevelDefinition`.
*   **UI (`/lib/ui`):** Flutter widgets, screens, and `CustomPainter`s responsible for rendering the game state.

For a complete overview of the technical design, please see the **[Technical Requirements Document (TRD)](./DOCS/TRD.md)**.

## üìö Documentation

This project is documented using the following standards. All documents can be found in the `/DOCS` directory.

*   **[üìÑ Business Requirements (BRD)](./DOCS/BRD.md):** High-level goals, vision, and scope of the project.
*   **[üìÑ Functional Requirements (FRD)](./DOCS/FRD.md):** Detailed descriptions of what the application does from a user's perspective.
*   **[üìÑ Technical Requirements (TRD)](./DOCS/TRD.md):** A deep dive into the technical architecture, components, and data flow.

## üîÆ Future Improvements and Refactoring

This section outlines potential areas for improving and refactoring the codebase. These are great opportunities for new contributors to get familiar with the project.

### 1. Consolidate State Management Approach

*   **Current Situation:** The project currently uses a mix of state management patterns. The `GameEngine` is a `ChangeNotifier`, but it's provided to the UI using a `StateNotifierProvider` in `lib/providers/game_provider.dart`.
*   **Suggestion:** To make the state management more consistent and easier to understand, we should refactor this to use a `ChangeNotifierProvider` for the `GameEngine`. This aligns better with the `GameEngine`'s design and simplifies the provider setup.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/providers/game_provider.dart`

### 2. Enhance Error Handling in `LevelManager`

*   **Current Situation:** The `LevelManager` has basic error handling. If a level fails to load, it sets a generic error message.
*   **Suggestion:** We should make the error handling more robust and user-friendly. For example, if a specific level's JSON file is missing or corrupt, the UI should display a specific message (e.g., "Error loading Level 5. Please try again.") and potentially offer a "Retry" button.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/services/level_manager.dart`

### 3. Refactor `AssetManager` for Single Responsibility

*   **Current Situation:** The `AssetManager` is currently responsible for both *loading* assets (images, audio) and *drawing* some of the component assets to a canvas.
*   **Suggestion:** To follow the Single Responsibility Principle, we should refactor the `AssetManager`. The drawing logic should be extracted into a separate class, for example, a `ComponentPainter`. This would make the `AssetManager` solely responsible for loading and caching, leading to cleaner, more modular code.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/common/asset_manager.dart`

### 4. Centralize Constants and Remove Hardcoded Values

*   **Current Situation:** There are some "magic numbers" (hardcoded values) in the UI code, for example, the width of the component palette in `GameScreen`.
*   **Suggestion:** All hardcoded values should be replaced with constants defined in a central place, like `lib/common/constants.dart`. This makes the code easier to maintain and avoids inconsistencies.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/ui/game_screen.dart`

### 5. Implement Persistent Tutorial State

*   **Current Situation:** The `GameScreen` shows a tutorial overlay, but it doesn't remember if the user has seen it before.
*   **Suggestion:** We should use `shared_preferences` to save a flag indicating that the user has completed the tutorial for a specific level. This way, the tutorial is only shown the very first time a user plays a level, making for a better user experience.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/ui/game_screen.dart`

### 6. Ensure Consistent Use of Immutable Models

*   **Current Situation:** The project uses the `freezed` package for some of its models, which is great for ensuring immutability. However, not all models use it.
*   **Suggestion:** We should audit all the classes in the `lib/models` directory and ensure that any data class that would benefit from immutability is implemented using `freezed`. This makes our state more predictable and prevents accidental mutations.
*   **Files to look at:** The `lib/models` directory.
