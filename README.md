## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a clean, modular architecture that separates logic, state management, and UI.

*   **Services (`/lib/services`):** Stateless, reusable services like the `LogicEngine` and `LevelManager`.
*   **Engine (`/lib/engine`):** The `GameEngine` orchestrates the state and rules for an active game session.
*   **Models (`/lib/models`):** Plain Dart objects representing the game's data, such as `Grid`, `Component`, and `LevelDefinition`.
*   **UI (`/lib/ui`):** Flutter widgets, screens, and `CustomPainter`s responsible for rendering the game state.

For a complete overview of the technical design, please see the **[Technical Requirements Document (TRD)](./DOCS/TRD.md)**.

## üìö Documentation

This project is documented using the following standards. All documents can be found in the `/DOCS` directory.

*   **[üìÑ Business Requirements (BRD)](./DOCS/BRD.md):** High-level goals, vision, and scope of the project.
*   **[üìÑ Functional Requirements (FRD)](./DOCS/FRD.md):** Detailed descriptions of what the application does from a user's perspective.
*   **[üìÑ Technical Requirements (TRD)](./DOCS/TRD.md):** A deep dive into the technical architecture, components, and data flow.

## üîÆ Future Improvements and Refactoring

This section outlines potential areas for improving and refactoring the codebase. These are great opportunities for new contributors to get familiar with the project. older

### 1. Consolidate State Management Approach

*   **Current Situation:** The project currently uses a mix of state management patterns. The `GameEngine` is a `ChangeNotifier`, but it's provided to the UI using a `StateNotifierProvider` in `lib/providers/game_provider.dart`.
*   **Suggestion:** To make the state management more consistent and easier to understand, we should refactor this to use a `ChangeNotifierProvider` for the `GameEngine`. This aligns better with the `GameEngine`'s design and simplifies the provider setup.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/providers/game_provider.dart`

### 2. Enhance Error Handling in `LevelManager`

*   **Current Situation:** The `LevelManager` has basic error handling. If a level fails to load, it sets a generic error message.
*   **Suggestion:** We should make the error handling more robust and user-friendly. For example, if a specific level's JSON file is missing or corrupt, the UI should display a specific message (e.g., "Error loading Level 5. Please try again.") and potentially offer a "Retry" button.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/services/level_manager.dart`

### 3. Refactor `AssetManager` for Single Responsibility

*   **Current Situation:** The `AssetManager` is currently responsible for both *loading* assets (images, audio) and *drawing* some of the component assets to a canvas.
*   **Suggestion:** To follow the Single Responsibility Principle, we should refactor the `AssetManager`. The drawing logic should be extracted into a separate class, for example, a `ComponentPainter`. This would make the `AssetManager` solely responsible for loading and caching, leading to cleaner, more modular code.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/common/asset_manager.dart`

### 4. Centralize Constants and Remove Hardcoded Values

*   **Current Situation:** There are some "magic numbers" (hardcoded values) in the UI code, for example, the width of the component palette in `GameScreen`.
*   **Suggestion:** All hardcoded values should be replaced with constants defined in a central place, like `lib/common/constants.dart`. This makes the code easier to maintain and avoids inconsistencies.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/ui/game_screen.dart`

### 5. Implement Persistent Tutorial State

*   **Current Situation:** The `GameScreen` shows a tutorial overlay, but it doesn't remember if the user has seen it before.
*   **Suggestion:** We should use `shared_preferences` to save a flag indicating that the user has completed the tutorial for a specific level. This way, the tutorial is only shown the very first time a user plays a level, making for a better user experience.
*   **File to look at:** `lib/ui/game_screen.dart`

### 6. Ensure Consistent Use of Immutable Models

*   **Current Situation:** The project uses the `freezed` package for some of its models, which is great for ensuring immutability. However, not all models use it.
*   **Suggestion:** We should audit all the classes in the `lib/models` directory and ensure that any data class that would benefit from immutability is implemented using `freezed`. This makes our state more predictable and prevents accidental mutations.
*   **Files to look at:** The `lib/models` directory.

### Code Review Recommendations (2025-08-13 EST)

Based on a recent code review, the following are prioritized recommendations to further enhance the codebase:

*   **1. Unify State Management:**
    *   **Goal:** Complete the migration to a single, consistent state management pattern using `flutter_riverpod` and `StateNotifier`.
    *   **Action:** Refactor the remaining `ChangeNotifier` and `provider` implementations to use `StateNotifierProvider`. This will simplify the architecture, reduce complexity, and improve maintainability.
    *   **Files to look at:** `lib/engine/game_engine.dart`, `lib/core/providers.dart`.

*   **2. Enhance Error Handling:**
    *   **Goal:** Provide more specific and user-friendly error feedback.
    *   **Action:** Modify services like `LevelManager` to return a `Result` type (e.g., using the `multiple_result` package) that encapsulates either a success value or a specific error type. This allows the UI to display more informative messages (e.g., "Level 5 is corrupt" instead of a generic "Failed to load").
    *   **Files to look at:** `lib/services/level_manager.dart`.

*   **3. Increase Test Coverage:**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the application is robust and prevent regressions.
    *   **Action:** Add comprehensive widget tests for new UI components (`ComponentPalette`, `LevelCard`) and unit tests for `StateNotifier` classes like `GameEngineNotifier`.
    *   **Files to look at:** `test/` directory.

*   **4. Refactor for Readability:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve code clarity and maintainability.
    *   **Action:** Break down large methods in `GameEngineNotifier` and `CanvasPainter` into smaller, single-purpose private helper methods.
    *   **Files to look at:** `lib/engine/game_engine_notifier.dart`, `lib/ui/canvas_painter.dart`.

*   **5. Enforce Universal Immutability:**
    *   **Goal:** Make the application state fully predictable and prevent side effects.
    *   **Action:** Audit the `lib/models` directory and convert all remaining plain Dart classes (e.g., `ComponentModel`, `Grid`) to be immutable using the `freezed` package.
    *   **Files to look at:** `lib/models/` directory.

## Changelog

### 2025-08-13 9pm

#### Asset Pipeline and Rendering Optimization
- **Enhanced `AssetManager` Caching**: The `AssetManager` has been significantly refactored to improve performance and flexibility. It now pre-caches SVG assets as `ui.Image` objects, offloading conversion work from the critical render loop. The previous `PictureInfo` caching has been replaced with a more robust system that stores raw SVG strings and the pre-rendered images.
- **Improved `AssetManager` API**: The service now exposes a more versatile API, allowing assets to be retrieved as a `ui.Image` (for canvas rendering), a raw `String`, or a `Widget`. It also includes new utility methods for querying asset statistics.
- **Decoupled `CanvasPainter`**: The `CanvasPainter` has been updated to consume the new `ui.Image` objects directly from the `AssetManager`. This decouples the painter from SVG-specific logic, making it more efficient and easier to maintain.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused imports from `level_select.dart` to improve code hygiene.
