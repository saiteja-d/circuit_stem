# Project Handover - Circuit STEM

## 1. Current Project Status

The `circuit_stem` application successfully runs in Chrome, indicating that the core codebase is functional. However, a critical issue is currently preventing automated tests from compiling and executing.

## 2. Primary Unresolved Issue: `Type 'Component' not found` in Test Environment

*   **Problem:** Tests consistently fail to compile with `Error: Type 'Component' not found` in `test/helpers/level_01_test_helper.dart`. This error occurs despite:
    *   Multiple `flutter clean` operations.
    *   Repeated verification and correction of import statements in both `test/helpers/level_01_test_helper.dart` and `test/level_01_revised_test.dart`.
    *   The `Component` model (`lib/models/component.dart`) and its Freezed-generated parts (`.freezed.dart`, `.g.dart`) appear correctly defined and are used successfully in the main application.
*   **Impact:** This issue completely blocks test execution on all platforms (macOS, Chrome).
*   **Recommended Investigation for Next Developer:**
    1.  **Isolate the Import:** Create a brand new, minimal test file that *only* attempts to import and use the `Component` model. See if this minimal test compiles. This could help determine if the issue is specific to `level_01_test_helper.dart`'s context or a broader problem with `Component` resolution in the test runner.
    2.  **Dart Analysis Server:** Investigate potential issues with the Dart analysis server's interaction with the test environment, especially concerning code generation (`freezed`, `json_serializable`) within tests.
    3.  **Test Runner Configuration:** Review Flutter test runner configurations for any settings that might interfere with package import resolution for generated files.
