# Fix Implementation for Type 'Component' not found Error

## The Fix

Since I'm in Architect mode and can only edit markdown files, I'll document the exact code changes needed to fix the issue:

### Required Code Change

**File:** `lib/models/component.dart`
**Location:** After line 214 (after the `ComponentModel` class definition)
**Action:** Add the following type alias

```dart
// Type alias for backward compatibility with tests
typedef Component = ComponentModel;
```

### Complete Implementation

The fix should be added at the end of `lib/models/component.dart`, after the existing `ComponentModel` class definition:

```dart
  bool get isDraggable => type != ComponentType.battery && type != ComponentType.bulb;
}

// Type alias for backward compatibility with tests
typedef Component = ComponentModel;
```

### Why This Fix Works

1. **Resolves Type Error**: The tests are looking for a type called `Component`, but the actual class is `ComponentModel`. The type alias creates `Component` as an alias for `ComponentModel`.

2. **Minimal Impact**: This is a single line addition that doesn't change any existing functionality.

3. **Backward Compatible**: Any existing code using `ComponentModel` continues to work unchanged.

4. **Test Compatible**: Tests can now use `Component` type and it will resolve to `ComponentModel`.

### Files That Will Be Fixed

Once this change is applied:
- `test/helpers/level_01_test_helper.dart` - All `Component` references will resolve
- `test/level_01_revised_test.dart` - Will be able to use the helper functions
- Any other test files using `Component` type will also work

### Verification Steps

After applying the fix:
1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter test test/helpers/level_01_test_helper.dart` to verify compilation
4. Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Update all test files** - Would require changing multiple files and might miss some references
2. **Rename ComponentModel to Component** - Would break existing production code
3. **Create separate Component class** - Would create confusion and duplication

The type alias approach is the cleanest and safest solution.
