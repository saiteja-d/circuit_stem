# Bug Report: Initial Level Components Are Not Rendering

**Date:** 2025-08-18
**Status:** Confirmed, Under Investigation
**Priority:** Critical

## 1. Summary

Users have reported that the initial components of a level (specifically the battery and bulb in Level 1) are not appearing on the grid when the level starts. The grid is empty, preventing any gameplay.

This issue was initially confused with a component placement bug, but has now been correctly identified as a failure to render the level's starting state.

## 2. Analysis & Investigation

A systematic investigation was performed to isolate the root cause:

1.  **Verified Level Data:** The `assets/levels/level_01.json` file was inspected. It **correctly** contains definitions for a `battery` (`bat1`) and a `bulb` (`bulb1`) in its initial component list. This rules out a problem with the level data itself.

2.  **Verified Asset Pipeline:** The application logs confirm that the `SvgProcessor` service is running correctly at startup and is processing 8 SVG assets into `ui.Image` objects, which are then passed to the `AssetManager`. This suggests the rendering assets are available.

3.  **Analyzed JSON Parsing:** The `lib/models/component.dart` file, specifically the `ComponentModel.fromJson` factory, was analyzed. The parsing logic appears to be correct and robust enough to handle the data format for all component types defined in the JSON file. No obvious errors were found that would cause specific components to be skipped during parsing.

4.  **Analyzed Rendering Logic:** The `lib/ui/canvas_painter.dart` file was analyzed. The `paint` method iterates through all components in the current `RenderState` and calls `_drawComponent` for each one. The logic within `_drawComponent` and `_getImagePathForComponent` does not appear to contain any filters that would cause it to skip drawing batteries or bulbs.

## 3. Conclusion of Static Analysis

The root cause of this bug is not apparent from a static analysis of the code. The data, parsing logic, and rendering logic all appear to be correct. This indicates that the failure is likely occurring at runtime due to an unexpected state or a subtle bug that is not visible in the code itself.

## 4. Next Steps: Runtime Debugging

The only way to effectively diagnose this issue is to inspect the application's state at runtime.

1.  **Inject Diagnostic Logging:** Add a `Logger.log` statement to the `_drawComponent` method within `lib/ui/canvas_painter.dart`. This log should output the ID, type, and position of every component that the painter is attempting to draw.

2.  **Run and Observe:** The application must be run again with the new logging in place.

3.  **Analyze New Logs:** The console output will definitively prove one of two hypotheses:
    *   **Hypothesis A:** The logs **do not** show messages for `bat1` or `bulb1`. This would prove that the components are being lost *before* the rendering stage, pointing to a subtle error in the `GameEngineState` or the `LevelDefinition` parsing that was missed.
    *   **Hypothesis B:** The logs **do** show messages for `bat1` and `bulb1`. This would prove the components are being processed by the painter, but are not visible for another reason (e.g., being drawn off-screen, with an incorrect size, or with a transparent color).

This targeted debugging is the critical next step to solving this issue.
