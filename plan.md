Plan: Isolate and fix the compile-time error Type 'Component' not found in tests

Objective
- Determine why the Component model is not being resolved in the test environment despite existing in lib/models and used by the app.

Actions
1) Confirm current test imports and generated files
- Inspect lib/models/component.dart and its generated part files (component.freezed.dart, component.g.dart).
- Review test/helpers/level_01_test_helper.dart and test/level_01_revised_test.dart imports to identify mismatches.

2) Create a minimal isolated test scaffold (non-invasive)
- Add a minimal test that only imports the Component model to verify resolution in the test runner.
- Ensure this does not alter production code paths.

3) Verify export/import structure
- Ensure lib/models exports index (if present) or that tests import via package:circuit_stem/models/component.dart directly.
- Check pubspec.yaml for test dependencies and any path overrides affecting test resolution.

4) Inspect test runner and code generation
- Look for references to generated code (freezed/json_serializable) in test context.
- Validate that test environment runs code generation as part of the build (flutter pub run build_runner test or equivalent, if used).

5) Check for common resolution issues
- Confirm that test Dart sdk constraints align with freezed/json_serializable versions.
- Ensure the generated .g.dart/.freezed.dart files exist on disk and are included in the test compilation.

6) Reproduce and narrow down
- Run a clean test build locally (flutter clean; flutter pub get; flutter test) focusing on the failing test path to capture exact errors.

7) Propose targeted fixes
- If imports are incorrect, adjust test files to use consistent package paths.
- If generated parts are missing, ensure part directives exist and are included in test scope.
- If necessary, add a centralized export in lib/models to simplify imports in tests.

8) Update documentation / changelog
- Note the root cause, proposed fix, and test plan in CHANGELOG.md and DOCS/TESTING.md.

9) Validate fix
- Execute a clean test run to confirm compilation passes and tests begin to execute.

10) Report results
- Provide a concise summary of findings, exact code changes if any, and next steps for the team.

Notes
- All changes should be scoped to tests or model exports without impacting runtime app behavior.
- Maintain existing coding standards and test conventions.
