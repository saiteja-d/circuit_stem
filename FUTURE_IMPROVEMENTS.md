# Future Improvements & Project Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-14

This document outlines the recommended next steps and potential future improvements for the `circuit_stem` project. It is based on the project's own documentation, code analysis, and established Flutter development best practices.

## 1. Testing & Quality Assurance

**Status:** **CRITICAL**. This is the highest priority area for improvement. The existing test suite is minimal and does not adequately cover the UI and state management logic, which was recently refactored.

### 1.1. Implement the Existing Test Plan

-   **Action:** Execute the detailed plan laid out in `DOCS/TESTING.md`.
    1.  **Add Keys to Widgets:** Add `GlobalKey` or `ValueKey` to all interactive widgets (e.g., `CircuitComponentWidget`, buttons in the `ComponentPalette`, level selection cards) to make them easily findable in widget tests.
    2.  **Implement Level 1 Test Suite:** Create the file `test/ui/level_01_interaction_test.dart` and implement the 30 test cases defined in the "Level 1 â€“ Comprehensive Circuit Test Cases" table. This will serve as a robust template for all other levels.

### 1.2. Increase Unit & Widget Test Coverage

-   **Rationale:** As stated in the `CHANGELOG.md` ("Next Priorities"), the refactored `StateNotifier` classes and UI components need comprehensive tests.
-   **Action: Test StateNotifiers:**
    -   Create unit test files for each `StateNotifier` (e.g., `test/engine/game_engine_notifier_test.dart`).
    -   Use a mocking framework like `mocktail` to mock dependencies (`LogicEngine`, `LevelManager`).
    -   Write tests that verify each public method on the notifier correctly updates the state to a new, expected immutable state.
-   **Action: Test UI Widgets:**
    -   Create widget test files for all major UI components (`GameCanvas`, `ComponentPalette`, `LevelCard`, etc.).
    -   Leverage Riverpod's testing features to override providers with mock notifiers.
    -   Verify that the widgets correctly render all possible states (e.g., loading, data, error, win-state, short-circuit).

## 2. Code Refactoring & Architecture

**Status:** High Priority. The project's architecture is strong, but completing the planned refactoring will improve consistency and maintainability.

### 2.1. Complete Immutability Migration

-   **Rationale:** A "pending improvement" noted in the `CHANGELOG.md`. Universal immutability is a core principle of the new architecture.
-   **Action:** Audit the `lib/models/` directory. Convert any remaining plain Dart classes to immutable classes using the `freezed` package and ensure all `copyWith` methods are utilized correctly in the notifiers.

### 2.2. Refactor Large Methods

-   **Rationale:** Another "pending improvement" from the `CHANGELOG.md`. Smaller, single-purpose methods are easier to read, test, and maintain.
-   **Action:** In `GameEngineNotifier` and `CanvasPainter`, identify methods that handle multiple distinct responsibilities. Refactor them into smaller, well-named private methods. For example, a large `handleTap` method could be broken down into `_getTappedComponent`, `_toggleComponentState`, and `_re_evaluateGrid`.

### 2.3. Modernize Riverpod Usage (Future Consideration)

-   **Rationale:** Web best practices indicate a shift in the Riverpod community from `StateNotifier` to the newer `Notifier` and `AsyncNotifier` providers due to their simpler API and more powerful features.
-   **Action:** This is not an urgent change. However, for any *new* providers created, prefer using `NotifierProvider` or `AsyncNotifierProvider`. A gradual migration of existing `StateNotifier`s can be considered in the long term.

## 3. Error Handling

**Status:** High Priority. This is explicitly listed as a "Next Priority" in the `CHANGELOG.md`.

### 3.1. Implement the `Result` Type

-   **Rationale:** Using an explicit `Result` or `Either` type (from packages like `fpdart`) makes error handling robust and predictable, preventing unexpected runtime exceptions.
-   **Action:**
    1.  Refactor `LevelManager` methods like `loadLevelByIndex` to return `Future<Result<LevelDefinition, Exception>>` instead of `Future<LevelDefinition>`.
    2.  Update the call sites in the UI layer to handle the `Result` type. This typically involves using a `when` or `fold` method to explicitly define the UI for both the success and failure cases (e.g., showing a `SnackBar` or an error message if a level fails to load).
    3.  Extend this pattern to other services involving I/O, such as file operations or future network calls.

## 4. Performance Optimization

**Status:** Medium Priority. These are valuable improvements that can be implemented incrementally.

### 4.1. Apply Static Analysis Fixes

-   **Rationale:** The `CHANGELOG.md` notes 16 remaining `prefer_const_constructors` warnings. These are easy performance wins.
-   **Action:** Run `dart fix --apply` or manually add the `const` keyword where suggested by the analyzer. This reduces widget rebuilds.

### 4.2. Use `RepaintBoundary`

-   **Rationale:** The `TRD.md` and general Flutter best practices recommend this for isolating complex animations.
-   **Action:** Wrap the `GameCanvas` widget in a `RepaintBoundary` widget. This ensures that the frequent repaints of the canvas do not trigger unnecessary repaints of other UI elements like the app bar or component palette.
